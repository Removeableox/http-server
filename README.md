# rust http-server 

An http server implementation following the "Final Project" tutorial from the official rust book.

The code is littered with comments for my own understanding of complex/new concepts.  

First project I wrote in a [series of server-related projects](https://github.com/Removeableox/forward-proxy-WIP)
